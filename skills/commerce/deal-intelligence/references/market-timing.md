# Market Timing Calendar & Signal Interpretation

## Timing Signal Summary

Quick-reference table of signals and the action each suggests. Referenced by `SKILL.md` section "3. Market Timing Analysis".

| Signal | Indicator | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Seasonality** | Post-holiday clearance, end-of-model-year | Buy after season peaks (e.g., grills in Sept, snow blowers in March) |
| **Upcoming weather** | Hurricane, tornado, wildfire season | Buy before demand spikes for generators, plywood, etc. |
| **Economic cycle** | Fed rate decisions, recession indicators | Large purchases (homes, cars) may benefit from rate drops |
| **Search traffic** | Google Trends rising for the product | Rising interest = rising prices; buy before the spike |
| **Ad cost signals** | CPM/CPC increases in the product's category | Sellers spending more on ads = demand is growing = buy now |
| **Product lifecycle** | New model announced, predecessor being cleared | Wait for clearance pricing on outgoing models |
| **Retail calendar** | Prime Day, Black Friday, Presidents Day, Memorial Day | Time purchase to known sale events if timeline allows |
| **Regulatory** | New tariffs, import restrictions, bans | Buy before regulation reduces supply |
| **Inventory signals** | "Only X left in stock", warehouse clearance | Low inventory with no restock = buy now; clearance = wait for deeper cuts |

| Retailer inventory surplus | Deeper discounts coming | Earnings calls, warehouse sale announcements |
| Post-season | Seasonal items drop 30–60% | Retail calendar above |

### Neutral / Watch Signals

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|
| Price stable for 90+ days | Fair market value established; deal unlikely without catalyst |
| Mixed reviews on new model | Wait 60–90 days for firmware/revision fixes before buying new |
| Trade show upcoming (CES, MWC, IFA) | New announcements may obsolete current picks; wait if timeline allows |

## Product Lifecycle Timing

```
[Announcement] → [Pre-order Premium +10-20%] → [Launch MSRP] → [3-month Settling -5%]
→ [6-month First Sales -10-15%] → [12-month Established -15-25%]
→ [Next Gen Announced → Clearance -25-40%] → [Discontinued → Scarcity +10%]
```

**Key insight**: The sweet spot for most electronics is 3–6 months after launch or immediately after the successor is announced.

## Macro-Economic Timing

- **Rising interest rates**: Bad time for large financed purchases (cars, homes); sellers may discount to compensate
- **Falling interest rates**: Good time for financed purchases; asset prices may rise so buy before the rush
- **High unemployment**: Sellers of discretionary goods discount aggressively; good time for furniture, electronics, vehicles
- **Supply chain disruption**: Buy early or buy used; new inventory gets expensive and scarce
- **Strong dollar**: Imported goods are cheaper; good time for electronics, European luxury goods
- **Weak dollar**: Domestic goods are relatively cheaper; avoid import-heavy categories
