# Constraint Attributes Index — Reference

Index of all constraint attributes and domain-specific checks. Referenced by
`SKILL.md` section "5. Constraint Identification". **Load only the attribute
and domain files that apply to the current purchase type** — do not load all
files. This index is the only file always read; everything else is
on-demand.

## How to Use This Index

1. Read the attribute table below
2. For each attribute, check the "When to load" column — if the condition
   matches the current purchase, load that reference file
3. Read the domain table below
4. If the purchase matches a domain, load that domain file
5. Surface all identified constraints in the Needs Discovery Brief
   `Constraints & Warnings` section

## Universal Attributes

These apply to most product purchases. Load when the condition matches.

| Attribute | When to load | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Obsolescence** | Item has software, firmware, cloud service, or ecosystem dependency (electronics, smart home, software, connected devices) | `attributes/obsolescence.md` |
| **Repairability** | Item has components that could fail and need repair/replacement (anything mechanical or electronic with a lifespan > 1 year) | `attributes/repairability.md` |
| **Total cost of ownership** | Item has ongoing costs: subscriptions, fuel, maintenance, insurance, parts, disposal (vehicles, appliances, printers, pools, boats, smart devices) | `attributes/total-cost-of-ownership.md` |
| **Used-specific risks** | User is considering a used or refurbished purchase (not buying new) | `attributes/used-risks.md` |
| **Situational fit** | Item could mismatch the user's environment: climate, infrastructure, space, or financing is involved | `attributes/situational-fit.md` |

## Conditional Attributes

These apply to specific scenarios. Load only when triggered.

| Attribute | When to load | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Defects & recalls** | Always check for any product — search recalls by model/serial. For used items, verify recalls were performed. Sources: [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls), [CPSC](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls), [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls) | Inline below — no separate file needed for basic recall checks |
| **Version pitfalls** | Item has known revision differences or model-year changes (search `<model> revision differences`, check serial number ranges) | Inline below |
| **Reliability data** | Item is expensive or safety-critical (search long-term reviews, MTTF data, forum failure reports) | Inline below |
| **Seller reputation** | Always check for marketplace/private sellers (BBB, Trustpilot, feedback score, account age) | Inline below |

### Inline Quick Checks (no separate file needed)

- **Recalls**: Search manufacturer + government recall databases by model and serial number. For used items, verify the recall was actually performed.
- **Version pitfalls**: "Never buy Model X revision 2; revision 3 fixed the motherboard issue." Check revision/serial before buying.
- **Reliability**: Check long-term review aggregation, forum failure reports, warranty claim rates. Does it fail gracefully or catastrophically?
- **Seller reputation**: BBB rating, Trustpilot score, return policy. For marketplace sellers: feedback % (99%+ for used), sold count, account age. For private sellers: verify identity, meet in public, never wire money.

## Domain-Specific Constraints

Load the domain file when the purchase matches that domain. Domain files
contain constraints that are unique to that product type and don't apply
elsewhere.

## Output: Constraints in the Needs Discovery Brief

Surface all identified constraints in the `Constraints & Warnings` section.
For each constraint:

- The constraint (what the problem is)
- Severity: ⚠️ caution / ❌ deal-breaker / ☢️ requires expert assessment
- Source (where the information came from)
- Recommended action: research further / avoid / mitigate / accept the risk

For real estate, recommend a professional inspection, survey, title search,
and soil/water testing before any purchase commitment.
