# Automobile Constraints — Domain Index

Domain-specific constraints for automobiles. Referenced by
`references/constraint-attributes.md`. Load when the user is buying, leasing, or
financing any vehicle.

Vehicles are high-value depreciating assets with recurring ownership costs
(insurance, fuel, maintenance, registration) that can exceed the purchase price
over the ownership period. A wrong decision compounds over years.

## How to Use This Index

1. Read the generic constraints below (apply to all vehicles)
2. Identify the vehicle type and load the matching sub-domain file
3. Surface all identified constraints in the Needs Discovery Brief

## Sub-Domain Files

| Sub-domain | When to load | Reference |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **EV / PHEV** | User is buying a battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle | `ev-phev.md` |
| **Hybrid** | User is buying a traditional (non-plug-in) hybrid vehicle | `hybrid.md` |
| **Exotic / Sports** | User is buying a high-end sports car, supercar, or exotic | `exotic.md` |
| **Truck** | User is buying a pickup truck (for payload, towing, or work use) | `truck.md` |
| **RV / Motorhome** | User is buying a motorhome, camper van, or towable RV | `rv.md` |

Sedans, vans, and standard passenger cars use only the generic constraints
below — no separate sub-domain file is needed.

## Generic Constraints (All Vehicle Types)

### Title & History

- **Title check**: Verify title status via [NICB
  VINCheck](https://vincheck.nicb.org/) — clean, salvage, or rebuilt. A
  salvage/rebuilt title means the vehicle was declared a total loss. Financing
  and insurance are harder to obtain; resale value drops 20–40%.
- **VIN history report**: Pull a vehicle history report (Carfax, AutoCheck) by
  VIN. Check for: accident history, odometer rollback, number of owners,
  service records, flood damage, lemon history, structural damage. A clean
  report does not guarantee no problems — it means no reported problems.
- **Recall check**: Search the VIN on the [NHTSA recall
  database](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls). Open recalls should be fixed by the
  dealer for free, but unrepaired recalls indicate a prior owner who deferred
  maintenance. Check for Takata airbag recalls specifically — these are
  dangerous and long-running.

### Inspection & Insurance

- **Pre-purchase inspection (PPI)**: Always get a PPI from an independent
  mechanic before buying a used vehicle. Cost: $100–$300. This is the single
  best investment in the buying process. It catches hidden problems the seller
  won't disclose and the history report won't show.
- **Insurance cost verification**: Get an insurance quote **before** committing
  to a purchase. Insurance costs vary wildly by vehicle model, driver profile,
  and location. A "cheap" car can have expensive insurance. Check comprehensive,
  collision, and liability costs separately.

### Financing

- **APR comparison**: Get pre-approved from a credit union and/or bank before
  visiting the dealer. Compare the offered APR against the dealer's financing.
  Dealers can mark up the interest rate (reserve) — a 2% markup on a $30k loan
  over 60 months costs ~$1,600 extra.
- **Credit union vs bank vs dealer**:

  | Source | Typical APR advantage | Notes |
  |--------|----------------------|-------|
  | Credit union | Often lowest | Member-owned, member-focused rates |
  | Bank | Competitive | Existing relationship may help |
  | Dealer | Can be lowest (captive) or highest | Manufacturer incentives (0% APR) can win, but watch for rate markup |

- **Loan term**: Longer terms (72–84 months) lower monthly payments but
  increase total interest and risk being "underwater" (owing more than the car
  is worth) due to depreciation.

### Depreciation

- **Depreciation curve**: New cars lose ~20% of value driving off the lot, and
  ~40% by year 3. By year 5, most cars retain 40–50% of original value.
  Depreciation is the largest ownership cost for most vehicles.
- **Buying 3–5 years old** avoids the steepest depreciation while still
  capturing most of the vehicle's useful life.

### Registration & Fees

- **Registration/fees by state**: Varies significantly. Some states charge a
  flat fee; others base it on vehicle value, weight, or age. California, for
  example, charges a percentage of vehicle value (declining with age). Check
  the DMV website for the target state. Factor in sales tax (can be 0–10%+
  depending on state), title transfer fees, and documentation fees (dealer
  doc fees range $75–$800+ by state).

### Emissions Inspection

- **Emission inspection requirements by state**: Some states require periodic
  emissions testing (e.g., California, New York, Illinois in certain
  counties); others have no requirement. Check the state's DMV/environmental
  agency. A vehicle that fails emissions may require expensive repairs to
  register. Diesel vehicles and older vehicles face stricter scrutiny in some
  states.

## Recommendation

For any vehicle purchase, always recommend: a VIN history report, a recall
check, an independent PPI, and an insurance quote before committing. Surface
all identified constraints in the Needs Discovery Brief with severity levels:

- ⚠️ caution — research further before proceeding
- ❌ deal-breaker — recommend against the purchase
- ☢️ requires expert assessment — professional inspection needed
