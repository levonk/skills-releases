## Overview

The generic coverage mapping methodology (defining dimensions, the 5-level icon
scale, identifying gaps and overlaps) is defined in the shared
`comparison-methodology` include. This file adds project-specific assessment
methods and a coverage map template.

# Comparison Methodology

Shared methodology for comparing multiple items to determine category membership,
map what parts of a category each item addresses, and produce a feature matrix.
Included by `project-comparison` (software projects) and `ai-skill-upsert`
research phase (AI skills). Domain-specific metadata gathering, search tactics,
and meta-features stay in each skill's own reference files.

## Category Discovery (3-Tier)

Determine whether all items belong to the same category, and discover candidate
items when the user provides only a category name.

1. **Known names** — start from items the user names or that are well-known in
   the category. Read each item's description; extract category signals
   (self-description, tags, topics, "alternatives" sections).
2. **Category search** — search for additional items explicitly tagged or
   described as belonging to the category. Filter by relevance, activity, and
   significance.
3. **Adjacent categories** — look at neighboring categories that may overlap.
   Include adjacent-category items only if they meaningfully compete in the
   target category.

### Membership Verification

| Signal | Strong evidence | Weak evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Self-description | Explicitly names the category | Mentions a related keyword |
| Tags/topics | Tags include the category | Tags are related but not the category |
| Community perception | Listed in curated category lists, comparison articles | Mentioned in a tangential discussion |
| Functionality | Core functionality addresses the category's primary use case | Has a feature that overlaps with the category |

**Rule**: An item is a member if it has at least 2 strong signals, or 1 strong +
2 weak signals. Items with only weak signals are "borderline" and should be
flagged to the user.

### Handling Mismatches

When items don't all belong to the same category:

1. **Report the mismatch clearly**: Name the category each item belongs to and
   explain why they differ.
2. **Offer options**:
   - **Narrow**: Exclude non-matching items and compare only same-category ones.
   - **Broaden**: Expand the category definition to encompass all items (if
     reasonable).
   - **Cross-category comparison**: Proceed but label it as cross-category,
     noting the different categories in the matrix.
3. **Respect the user's choice**: If the user wants to compare across categories
   despite the mismatch, do so — but make the category difference visible.

## Coverage Mapping

Determine which parts of a category each item addresses. A category is defined
by a set of **dimensions** (capabilities, features, use cases). Each item covers
some dimensions fully, some partially, and lacks others.

### Defining Category Dimensions

1. **Start from the category's purpose**: What problem does this category solve?
2. **Identify core capabilities**: What capabilities are essential to deliver
   that purpose?
3. **Identify extended capabilities**: What capabilities differentiate items
   within the category?
4. **Identify integration capabilities**: How do items integrate with the
   broader ecosystem?
5. **Check existing comparisons**: Look at existing comparison articles,
   curated lists, and item documentation for dimensions others have used.

Aim for 8-15 dimensions. Too few misses meaningful distinctions; too many makes
the matrix unwieldy.

Organize dimensions into groups: **Core** (essential), **Extended**
(differentiating), **Integration** (ecosystem connections), **Operations**
(deployment/maintenance), **DX** (developer/user experience).

### 5-Level Coverage Scale

For each item × dimension, assign a coverage rating using the full 5-level
icon scale (matching the `feature-matrix` rule):

| Icon | Meaning | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 🏆 | Best-in-class | Standout, industry-leading implementation — the item's marquee feature |
| ✅ | Full support | First-class, well-supported feature |
| ➖ | Partial support | Supported but limited, requires plugins, or has caveats |
| ⚠️ | Problematic | Exists but broken, deprecated, actively harmful, or has serious known issues |
| ❌ | Not supported | Not addressed, or requires significant custom work |

Reserve 🏆 for true standouts (not every ✅ is a 🏆). Use ⚠️ when a feature
exists but is broken or deprecated — distinct from ➖ (works but limited) and ❌
(doesn't exist).

### Identifying Gaps and Overlaps

After mapping all items:

1. **Table-stakes dimensions**: All items have ✅. Baseline — move to bottom of
   matrix.
2. **Differentiating dimensions**: Items vary. Most interesting — keep prominent.
3. **Gap dimensions**: No item has ✅. Unmet needs — note in recommendation.
4. **Unique dimensions**: Only one item has ✅. Competitive advantage —
   highlight in recommendation.

## Matrix Output Format

The feature matrix follows the `feature-matrix` rule for icons and table
layout. Additional structural guidance:

### Table Structure

- **Items across the top** (column headers), with inline links
- **Features down the side** (row headers), grouped into sections
- **Icons in cells** for quick visual comparison
- **Identical-value rows at the bottom** (features where all items have the
  same rating)

### Meta-Features Section

The top of the table contains standard meta-features that apply to all
comparisons. Each skill defines its own meta-features appropriate to its domain
(see the skill's own reference files for the specific meta-features to include).

### Recommendation Framework

Structure recommendations **by use case, not by item**. Each bullet is a
use-case context, and names the item that fits best with a one-line reason.

**Order recommendations progressively** — either least→most demanding or
most→least demanding — and pick a direction and stick with it. This gives the
reader a natural escalation path: "start here, move up when you outgrow it."

#### Choosing Recommendation Axes

Pick 3-6 axes that represent the real decision dimensions a user faces. Common
axis families:

| Axis family | Example axes | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Expertise / complexity** | Beginner, intermediate, expert | Tools with steep learning curves |
| **Scale** | No scale needs, medium, high scale, enterprise | Tools where architecture affects throughput |
| **Performance** | Latency-sensitive, throughput-focused, balanced | Tools where perf characteristics differ meaningfully |
| **Rigor / compliance** | Quick-and-dirty, production-grade, regulated/audit | Tools where operational maturity matters |
| **Deployment context** | Homelab, small team, enterprise, cloud-native | Self-hosted tools, platforms, infrastructure |
| **Team composition** | Solo developer, small team, large org | Collaboration-heavy tools |
| **Ecosystem preference** | React ecosystem, Python-native, language-agnostic | Tools tied to a language or framework ecosystem |

Don't use all families — pick the 3-6 most relevant to the category being
compared.

#### Recommendation Template

```markdown
## Recommendation

*(Ordered from least to most demanding)*

- **For [use case A]**: Item X — [reason: why it fits]
- **For [use case B]**: Item Y — [reason: why it fits]
- **For [use case C]**: Item Z — [reason: why it fits]
- **Avoid**: Item W — [reason: abandoned, critical issues, or outclassed]
- **Watch**: Item V — [reason: new but promising, not production-ready yet]
```

Include **Avoid** only if an item genuinely should be avoided. Include **Watch**
only if there's an item worth tracking that isn't ready for recommendation yet.


## Project-Specific Assessment Methods

When assessing project coverage for each dimension:

1. **Read the docs**: Check the project's documentation for explicit mentions
   of the dimension.
2. **Check the code**: Look for configuration options, modules, or packages
   related to the dimension.
3. **Check issues/PRs**: Search for open issues requesting the feature (signals
   it's missing) or closed PRs adding it (signals it exists or is coming).
4. **Check examples/plugins**: Look at the plugin/theme ecosystem for
   community-provided support.
5. **Use the full scale**: Reserve 🏆 for true standouts (not every ✅ is a 🏆).
   Use ⚠️ when a feature exists but is broken, deprecated, or has serious
   issues — this is distinct from ➖ (works but limited) and ❌ (doesn't exist).
