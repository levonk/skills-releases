# Pin Image Digests, Not Tags

## Failure Mode

Using mutable tags (`node:26-slim`, `python:3`, `latest`, `nightly`) in
`FROM` lines. Tags can be repointed to a different build — by accident or on
purpose — and your "reproducible" build silently changes underneath you.

## Symptoms

- A build that worked yesterday fails today with no code change.
- A build that worked yesterday behaves differently today (the base image
  shipped a regression).
- Internal images are worse than official ones: mistakes in tag repointing
  are far more common when there's no public scrutiny.

## Practice

Pin every `FROM` line to an immutable digest for production images.

```dockerfile
# Mutable — the tag can move
FROM node:26-slim

# Immutable — pinned forever
FROM node:26-slim@sha256:<digest>
```

### How to find the digest

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect node:26-slim
```

Returns the immutable build digest SHA. Add it to the `FROM` line:

```dockerfile
FROM node:26-slim@sha256:0f4a7b1a3b2c...<full digest>
```

### When to pin vs not

| Context | Pin? | Reason |
|---------|------|--------|
| Production images | **Yes** | Reproducibility, supply-chain integrity |
| Internal images | **Yes** | Internal mistakes are more common than upstream |
| Dev / local | Optional | Convenience of `latest` may outweigh reproducibility |
| CI base images | **Yes** | CI must be reproducible |
