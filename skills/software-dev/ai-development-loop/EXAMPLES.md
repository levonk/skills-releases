# AI Development Loop - Examples

## Example 1: Feature Implementation

### Scenario
Implementing user authentication in a web application.

### Step-by-Step Execution

```bash
# 0. Foundation Check
git status
# On branch feature/auth
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/auth'
# nothing to commit, working tree clean

just test && just lint
# All tests passed
# No linting errors

# 1. Ticket Selection
tkr ready
# Selected: ja-4a2b1 - Add JWT authentication

# 2. Start Work
tkr start ja-4a2b1
tkr add-note ja-4a2b1 "Starting JWT authentication implementation with refresh tokens"

# 3. Implementation
# (Implementation work done here)
# - Created JWT service
# - Added auth middleware
# - Updated user model
# - Added login/logout endpoints
# - Wrote comprehensive tests

# 4. Verification
just test
# 42 tests passed, 0 failed

just lint
# No linting errors

just typecheck
# Type checking passed

# 5. Completion
tkr add-note ja-4a2b1 "JWT auth complete with refresh tokens. All tests passing. Ready for security review."
tkr ready ja-4a2b1

# 6. Commit Changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add JWT authentication with refresh tokens

- Implement JWT service with access/refresh token flow
- Add authentication middleware for protected routes
- Create login/logout endpoints with proper error handling
- Update user model with token storage
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Update API documentation

Fixes: ja-4a2b1"

# 7. Reflection
# Reflection notes added to ticket:
# - Pattern: Auth service structure could be boilerplated
# - Opportunity: Create auth-testing skill for common auth test patterns
# - Learning: Refresh token rotation is complex, needs clear documentation
```

### Reflection Outcome

**Process Reflection:**
- What went well: Clear requirements made implementation straightforward
- What obstacles: Refresh token security considerations took extra research
- Process improvements: Create security checklist for auth features

**Opportunities Identified:**
- **Boilerplate**: Auth service structure (JWT service, middleware, routes)
- **Skill**: Auth testing patterns (login/logout, token validation, security tests)
- **Template**: API endpoint structure for auth

## Example 2: Bug Fix

## Integration Examples

### Using with Code Review Skill

```bash
# During verification step of AI Development Loop
tkr start ja-1a2b3
# ... implementation work ...

# Use code-review skill before marking ready
"Please review this implementation using code-review skill"
# Code review skill applied, issues found and fixed

tkr ready ja-1a2b3
```

### Using with Frontend Design Skill

```bash
# For UI/UX tickets
tkr start ja-4c5d6
"Use frontend-design skill to implement this user profile page"
# Frontend design skill guides implementation

# Verification includes design system checks
tkr ready ja-4c5d6
```

### Creating New Skills from Reflection

```bash
# After reflection identifies pattern
tkr add-note ja-7f8e9 "Reflection: Auth testing pattern repeated. Creating auth-testing skill."

# Use ai-skill-upsert to codify the pattern
"Use ai-skill-upsert to create auth-testing skill based on discovered patterns"
# New skill created and available for future use
```
