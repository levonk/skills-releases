# Fetch and rebase onto upstream/main (or origin/main for direct-access clones).
# Usage: sync-upstream.sh [upstream_branch]
# Run this right before pushing — it's the safety net that catches upstream
# movement during the work phase (steps 7-17). The early sync in setup-branch.sh
# shrinks the conflict surface; this one guarantees the push is from a fresh base.
# Exits non-zero on rebase failure (conflicts or dirty tree) so the caller
# can resolve before pushing.
