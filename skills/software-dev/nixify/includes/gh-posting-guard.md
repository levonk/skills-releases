## CRITICAL — How to post these bodies to GitHub (read before any `gh` call)

The template below contains markdown backticks (`` ` `` and triple-fence ``` ``` ```), shell-style `$VARS` (`$UPSTREAM_OWNER`, `$UPSTREAM_REPO`, `$CURRENT_USER`), and real newlines. If you pass it to `gh` the wrong way, GitHub stores garbage. Two failure modes have shipped broken PRs/issues in the wild:

1. **Literal `\n` in the body** — happens when you reconstruct the body as a single-line string with `\n` escape sequences (e.g. an LLM-emitted string literal) and pass it to `gh --body "..."`. The `\n` is stored verbatim as two characters, not a newline. The whole post becomes one unreadable line.
2. **Stripped code spans + empty variables** — happens when you feed the body through an unquoted shell heredoc (`cat <<EOF` instead of `cat <<'EOF'`) or `echo "..."`. Backticks get command-substituted (`` `flake.nix` `` runs as a command → empty), and `$UPSTREAM_OWNER` is expanded by the shell to empty.

**Always do this, no exceptions:**

1. Substitute the four placeholders by **text replacement** (not shell expansion): `$UPSTREAM_OWNER`, `$UPSTREAM_REPO`, `$CURRENT_USER`, and `<issue-number>` / `<platform>` / `<project-name>`. Use `sed -i`/`perl -pi -e` or edit the file in your editor tool — never let bash expand `$UPSTREAM_OWNER`.
2. Write the final body to a **file** (e.g. `/tmp/pr-body.md`).
3. Post with `--body-file`, never `--body`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --repo "$UPSTREAM_OWNER/$UPSTREAM_REPO" --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
   gh issue create --repo "$UPSTREAM_OWNER/$UPSTREAM_REPO" --title "..." --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md
   ```
4. Before posting, sanity-check the file: `grep -c '\\n' /tmp/pr-body.md` must return `0` (no literal backslash-n), and `grep -n '`'` must show the backtick code spans intact.

**Never** use `gh ... --body "$BODY"` with an inline string. **Never** use an unquoted heredoc to build the body. The `--body-file` path is the only one that survives multi-line markdown with backticks and `$` intact.
