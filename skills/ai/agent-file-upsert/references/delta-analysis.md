# Delta Analysis

When updating an existing AGENTS.md (not creating from scratch), analyze what
changed in the repository since the AGENTS.md was last updated. This surfaces
new patterns, removed patterns, and practices that were reverted or abandoned
— raw material for improvements and anti-patterns.

## Two-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Script — Generate Structured Report

Run the delta analysis script to produce a deterministic, structured report
of repository changes since the AGENTS.md was last updated:

```bash
uv run --script scripts/analyze_git_delta.py {REPO_ROOT} --agents-file AGENTS.md --verbose
```

The script determines the "last updated" date from:
1. The `date.updated` field in the AGENTS.md frontmatter (if present)
2. The last git commit that modified the AGENTS.md file (fallback)

It then produces a structured report with:

- **Commit summary**: count, date range, top contributors
- **New files**: files added since the cutoff, grouped by directory
- **Deleted files**: files removed since the cutoff
- **New directories**: directories that appeared since the cutoff
- **Changed patterns**: new test files, new config files, new scripts
- **Revert/removal commits**: commits with "revert", "remove", "delete",
  "switch from", "replace", "deprecate" in their messages — these are
  anti-pattern candidates
- **New dependencies**: packages added to package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.
- **Removed dependencies**: packages removed — may indicate anti-patterns

The script output is JSON (machine-readable) with a `--verbose` human-readable
summary. See `scripts/analyze_git_delta.py` for the full output schema.

### Stage 2: Subagent — Interpret the Report

Spawn a subagent to interpret the structured report and extract:

1. **Positive things to add to AGENTS.md**: new patterns, new conventions,
   new directories that should be documented, new dependencies that change
   the tech stack, new test patterns worth noting.

2. **Negative things (anti-pattern candidates)**: practices that were
   reverted, removed, or replaced. The subagent examines the revert/removal
   commits and their context to determine:
   - What was the harmful practice?
   - Why was it removed/reverted? (commit message, surrounding discussion)
   - What replaced it? (if anything)
   - Is this worth recording as an anti-pattern?

3. **Improvement candidates**: new patterns or tools that suggest the
   AGENTS.md should be updated to recommend them, or gaps in the current
   documentation that the changes reveal.

#### Subagent Prompt Template

```
You are analyzing repository changes to extract documentation updates.

Repository: {REPO_ROOT}
Delta report (JSON): {script output}

Your task:
1. Read the delta report carefully.
2. For each category of change, determine whether it represents:
   a. A POSITIVE change that should be documented in AGENTS.md (new pattern,
      new convention, new directory, new dependency, new test approach)
   b. A NEGATIVE finding — a practice that was reverted, removed, or replaced
      (anti-pattern candidate)
   c. An IMPROVEMENT candidate — something that could be improved in the
      architecture, standards, or processes based on what changed
3. For anti-pattern candidates, examine the revert/removal commits to
   understand WHY the practice was abandoned. Use git show <commit> to read
   the full commit message and diff context.
4. Output three lists:
   - POSITIVE: things to add to AGENTS.md (with specific file references)
   - NEGATIVE: anti-pattern candidates (with origin: which commits, why)
   - IMPROVEMENTS: improvement candidates (with rationale from the changes)

Be specific. Reference actual file paths, commit hashes, and patterns. Do not
speculate — if you can't determine why something was removed, say so and flag
it for human review.
```

#### Subagent Delegation

Use the `run_subagent` tool with the `subagent_explore` profile (read-only —
the subagent only reads git history and files, it does not modify anything).
Pass the full delta report JSON and the prompt template above. The subagent
returns three categorized lists that the main agent uses to:

1. Update AGENTS.md with positive findings
2. Create anti-pattern files in `internal-docs/anti-patterns/` for negative
   findings (using the anti-patterns template)
3. Create improvement files in `internal-docs/improvements/` for improvement
   candidates (using the improvements template)

description: Guidance for delegating work to subagents with reduced initial memory — front-load context, review results, and choose serialization vs parallelization deliberately
---

### Subagent Delegation

When the runtime supports subagents that start with a reduced (or fresh) context window, prefer delegation over doing the work in the orchestrator's context. The orchestrator's context is a scarce, shared resource; a subagent's fresh context is cheap and disposable.

#### Step Marker: `[fork]`

A workflow or skill author can tag a step with `[fork]` to signal that this step is a strong delegation candidate. The marker is a pointer, not a directive — it says "consider forking this to a subagent" without restating the full guidance below.

**When you see `[fork]` on a step:** apply the delegation protocol in this include (front-load context, review the result, choose serialization vs parallelization for any sibling `[fork]` steps).

**When authoring — mark a step with `[fork]` only if:**

- The step is self-contained (a subagent can complete it without asking back).
- The step is context-heavy (doing it in the orchestrator would burn context the orchestrator needs later).
- The step has a clear deliverable the orchestrator can review.

Do NOT mark every step. Steps needing orchestrator judgment, iterative back-and-forth, or cross-step state belong in the orchestrator — marking those `[fork]` is noise.

**Example:**

```markdown
1. Read the user's request and identify the target module.
2. `[fork]` Search the codebase for all callers of `parseConfig()` and return the file:line list.
3. Based on the caller list, decide which callers need updating.
4. `[fork]` For each caller identified in step 3, apply the signature change and run its targeted test.
```

Steps 2 and 4 are marked: both are self-contained, context-heavy, and have reviewable deliverables. Step 3 is not — it's the orchestrator's judgment call using step 2's output. Step 4 forks are parallelizable (independent callers), but each depends on step 3's decision, so they serialize after step 3.

#### When to Delegate

Delegate when the work is **self-contained** — the subagent can complete it without asking clarifying questions back. Subagents are stateless: they cannot see the orchestrator's context and cannot prompt for clarification. If a task needs iterative back-and-forth, do it in the orchestrator.

Good delegation candidates: a bounded search, a file transform with a known shape, a single function implementation, a review of a specific diff, a one-shot investigation with a defined deliverable.

#### Front-Load the Starting Context

A subagent succeeds or fails on the prompt it's given. Before dispatching, assemble a complete starting context:

- **Goal**: what the subagent should produce, in one sentence.
- **Inputs**: exact file paths, symbol names, line ranges, or URLs it should read. Don't make it search for what you already know.
- **What's already known**: findings the orchestrator has already established that the subagent would otherwise re-derive.
- **Constraints**: conventions to follow, what NOT to touch, output format expected.
- **What to return**: the specific artifact or answer shape the orchestrator needs back.

If you can't write this prompt confidently, the task isn't ready to delegate — finish scoping it in the orchestrator first.

#### Review the Subagent's Work

Delegation is not abdication. After the subagent returns:

1. **Verify the deliverable** against the goal stated in the prompt. Check it actually does what was asked, not just what was literally typed.
2. **Check the blast radius**: did it edit only what was intended? Grep callers of any function it touched.
3. **Run the smallest check that would fail if the work is wrong** — typecheck, a targeted test, or an assert-based self-check.
4. **Re-dispatch only the failing slice** if the result is partially correct. Don't re-run the whole task for one fix.

#### Serialization vs Parallelization

Choose deliberately, not by default:

- **Parallel** when tasks are independent (no shared output, no read-after-write dependency between them). Launch all in one batch and collect results as they complete. Example: reviewing three unrelated PRs, searching three unrelated code areas.
- **Serial** when one task's output is another's input, or when tasks write to the same files/state. Running them in parallel produces conflicts or wasted work. Example: implement, then test the implementation, then refactor based on test results.

When unsure, ask: "does task B need to read what task A produced?" If yes, serialize. If no, parallelize.

#### Anti-Patterns

- **Vague dispatch**: "investigate the auth flow" with no file paths. The subagent re-explores what the orchestrator already knows.
- **Delegating the decision, not the work**: asking a subagent to "decide the approach" when the orchestrator should own strategy. Delegate execution, keep judgment.
- **Parallelizing dependent tasks**: spawning implement + test simultaneously, then the test runs against code that doesn't exist yet.
- **Serializing independent tasks "to be safe"**: three independent searches run one-after-another when they could have run concurrently. Costs 3x the wall time for no safety gain.
- **Skipping review**: trusting the subagent's self-report without running a check. The subagent's "done" and the orchestrator's "correct" are different bars.

subagent patterns and when to use them.

## When to Run Delta Analysis

- **Always when updating an existing AGENTS.md** (not creating from scratch)
- **Skip if the user explicitly says "skip delta analysis"** or
  "just update the docs I pointed you at"
- **Skip if the AGENTS.md was created today** (no meaningful delta to analyze)
- **Skip if the repository has no git history** (not a git repo, or empty
  history)

## Scope Control

The user may specify the scope of delta analysis:

- **Whole repo** (default): analyze all changes since the cutoff date
- **Specific path**: `--path src/auth/` — only analyze changes under that path
- **Tree up and down**: `--path src/auth/ --include-parents` — analyze the
  specified path plus parent and child AGENTS.md scopes

When the user asks to update AGENTS.md for a specific subtree, scope the
delta analysis to that subtree. The improvements and anti-patterns files go
in the relevant package's `internal-docs/anti-patterns/{package}/` directory.

## Output Integration

The delta analysis output feeds directly into:

1. **AGENTS.md updates** (Phase 2-3): positive findings become new content in
   the root or sub-folder AGENTS.md files
2. **Anti-patterns files** (Phase 4b): negative findings become new files in
   `internal-docs/anti-patterns/`
3. **Improvements files** (Phase 4c): improvement candidates become new files
   in `internal-docs/improvements/`

All three outputs use the templates referenced in their respective reference
files. The main agent is responsible for writing the files — the subagent
only produces the categorized lists.
