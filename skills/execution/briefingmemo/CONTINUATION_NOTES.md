# BriefingMemo Skill - Continuation Notes

## Current Status
The BriefingMemo skill has been created at `~/p/gh/levonk/dotfiles/home/current/.chezmoitemplates/config/ai/skills/execution/briefingmemo/`

## Pending Work

### 1. Enhance with Committee Patterns
Based on existing committees in `~/p/gh/levonk/dotfiles/home/current/.chezmoitemplates/config/ai/committees/`:

#### Changes to Implement:
- Add YAML frontmatter structure following committee pattern
- Incorporate deliberation protocols:
  - `situational-analysis` (Leadership Council)
  - `context-adaptive-blending` (Management Council)

  - `wisdom-synthesis` (Legendary CEOs)
- Enhance conflict resolution methods:
  - `context-matching`
  - `team-needs-prioritization`
  - `strategic-alignment`
  - `principle-weighting`
- Add leadership styles to agent personas:
  - Transformational
  - Transactional
  - Servant
  - Autocratic

### 2. Output Format Enhancement
- Make current output format a **minimum** not maximum
- Allow committee to add sections dynamically based on decision context
