# Upstream Identity

## Rule

When contributing to an upstream project via a fork, ALL user-facing
content — code files, documentation, commit messages, issue bodies, PR
bodies, README sections — MUST reference the upstream repository
(`upstream-owner/upstream-repo`), NOT the fork
(`your-user/upstream-repo`).

The fork is only for development and testing. Once the PR merges, the
flake/install instructions/docs must work against the upstream repo, not
your fork (which may be deleted or archived).

## What to Check

| Artifact | Reference | Common Mistake |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| `flake.nix` homepage URL | `github.com/upstream-owner/repo` | `github.com/your-user/repo` |
| README install instructions | `nix run github:upstream-owner/repo` | `nix run github:your-user/repo` |
| PR body install examples | `github:upstream-owner/repo` | `github:your-user/repo` |
| Issue "Implementation" link | `github.com/your-user/repo/tree/branch` | (this one correctly points to the fork) |
| Docs site install page | upstream URLs | fork URLs |

The exception is the "Implementation" link in the orientation issue,
which correctly points to the fork branch where the work was done.

## Enforcement

Use variables (`$UPSTREAM_OWNER`, `$UPSTREAM_REPO`, `$CURRENT_USER`)
and substitute by text replacement, not shell expansion. See
[gh --body-file](gh-body-file.md) for why shell expansion corrupts these.
