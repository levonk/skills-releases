# Git Author Privacy

## Rule

Before committing, verify that `git config user.name` and
`git config user.email` are set to a public identity — not your system
hostname or local username. Use your GitHub username and the GitHub
noreply email.

```bash
git config user.name "your-github-username"
git config user.email "12345+your-github-username@users.noreply.github.com"
```

## Why

Git embeds the author name and email in every commit. If these contain
private information:

- **Hostname leakage** — `user.name` might be set to your machine's
  hostname (e.g., `micros-macbook-pro.local`). This reveals your
  hardware and network naming to anyone who reads the commit.
- **Username leakage** — `user.name` might be your OS username
  (e.g., `micro`). This is a partial identity leak.
- **Personal email exposure** — `user.email` might be a personal email
  that you don't want public in every commit on every repo you
  contribute to.

Once a commit is pushed to a public repo, the author metadata is
permanent. Even if you force-push to remove it, the original commit may
be cached by GitHub, forks, or CI logs.

## Detection

Check for private patterns in the author info:

```bash
NAME=$(git config user.name)
EMAIL=$(git config user.email)

# Flag if name matches hostname or OS username
echo "$NAME" | grep -qiE "$(hostname | sed 's/\..*//')|$(whoami)"
```

If the check matches, replace with a public identity before committing.

## GitHub Noreply Email

GitHub provides a noreply email that doesn't expose your real address:

```
<id>+<username>@users.noreply.github.com
```

Find your ID at [github.com/settings/emails](https://github.com/settings/emails).
Commits with this email are linked to your GitHub account without
exposing your personal address.
