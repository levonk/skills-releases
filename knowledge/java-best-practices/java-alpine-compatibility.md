# Java Alpine Compatibility

## Failure Mode

A Java application that runs fine on a Debian/Ubuntu JDK fails on Alpine
because Alpine uses `musl libc` instead of `glibc`, and a native library or
Java Native Interface (JNI) call expects glibc symbols.

## Symptoms

- `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError` for a `.so` that loads on Debian but not
  Alpine.
- Character encoding issues because `iconv` behavior differs between musl and
  glibc.
- `apk add build-base` is used as a workaround, but it adds GCC and compilers
  that should not be in a runtime image.
- The CoreDNS Alpine sidecar adds `gnu-libiconv` explicitly to work around
  `iconv` differences.

## Practice

### Prefer glibc for Applications with Native Dependencies

- If the application uses JNI, JNA, netty-tcnative, RocksDB, LMDB, or other
  native libraries, use a `debian:bookworm-slim` or `eclipse-temurin` base
  image (glibc-based).
- Use `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-jammy` or similar for a small, glibc-based JRE.

### When Alpine Is Correct for Java

- Infrastructure sidecars that only need a JRE and a small shell, with no JNI.
- The infrahub `java-sidecar` installs `openjdk17` via `apk` and runs a simple
  `java -version` healthcheck; it does not load native libraries.
- If you must use Alpine with glibc-dependent code, install `gcompat` or a
  `glibc`-compat package and test thoroughly.

### Build-Base Is Not a Fix

- `apk add build-base` installs a C toolchain. It does not make musl glibc.
- Native libraries compiled on Alpine with `build-base` are musl binaries and
  will not run on glibc systems.
