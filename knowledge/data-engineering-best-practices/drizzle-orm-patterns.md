# Drizzle ORM Patterns

## Failure Mode

TypeScript applications use raw SQL or ORM schemas that are not versioned,
leading to schema drift, untracked migrations, and queries that bypass type
safety.

## Symptoms

- A column rename in the database breaks application queries with no compile-time error.
- Migration files are written by hand and fail in CI because they are out of order.
- The schema is defined in multiple places (SQL, TypeScript types, runtime validators).
- Connection strings with credentials are hardcoded in the drizzle config.

## Practice

### Schema Definition

- Define tables in TypeScript using `drizzle-orm/pg-core`:

```typescript
import { pgTable, serial, varchar, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  email: varchar("email", { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

### Migrations

- Use `drizzle-kit generate` to generate migrations from schema changes.
- Store migrations in a `drizzle/` directory and run them with
  `drizzle-kit migrate` in CI/deploy.
- Never hand-edit generated migration files after they have been applied.

### Configuration

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/lib/db/schema.ts",
  out: "./drizzle",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.POSTGRES_URL!,
  },
});
```

- Load `POSTGRES_URL` from environment variables, not the config file.
- Use `POSTGRES_URL` from a secret manager in production.

### Query Patterns

- Keep query logic in repository/service files, not inline in UI components.
- Use Drizzle's query builder for type-safe queries.
- Use transactions for multi-step operations.
