# Security and Auditing

## Failure Mode

Vulnerable dependencies ship to production without detection. Secrets leak
through logging. Unsafe FFI causes undefined behavior. Missing input validation
allows injection attacks.

## Practice

### Security Checklist

- **Input validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Memory safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
- **Dependency auditing**: Regular security audits with `cargo audit`
- **Safe FFI**: Proper error handling for foreign function interfaces
- **Secrets management**: Never commit secrets, use environment variables

### Security Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
secrecy = "0.8"   # For secret handling
zeroize = "1.7"   # For secure memory clearing
```

### CI/CD Security

```bash
cargo audit    # Check for known vulnerabilities
cargo outdated # Check for outdated dependencies
```
