# Diagram Tool Selection

## Practice

Pick the diagram tool by **output type** and **rendering environment**, not by
general familiarity. The three tools serve orthogonal sweet spots and can be
mixed within one document.

| Tool | Source format | Renders in | Best for | VCS diffable |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Mermaid** | Text (fenced code block) | GitHub, Obsidian, VS Code, most static site generators | Flowcharts, decision trees, sequence diagrams embedded in markdown | ✅ Yes |
| **PlantUML** | Text (`@startuml`/`@enduml`) | Server (plantuml.com), local jar, Obsidian plugin | Precise UML (class, state, component, deployment), complex sequence diagrams | ✅ Yes |
| **Excalidraw** | `.excalidraw` JSON or binary | Excalidraw app, Obsidian plugin, npm package | Hand-drawn whiteboard sketches, architecture whiteboard sessions, low-fidelity mockups | ⚠️ JSON (diffable but noisy) |

### Decision tree

1. **Embedding in markdown that must render on GitHub/Obsidian without a
   plugin?** → **Mermaid**. Native fenced code block support, no server
   dependency.
2. **Need precise UML notation (class diagrams, state machines, component
   diagrams) with layout control?** → **PlantUML**. Richer UML vocabulary
   than Mermaid; server or local jar rendering.
3. **Whiteboard-style sketch where hand-drawn aesthetics communicate
   "tentative / work in progress"?** → **Excalidraw**. The sketch aesthetic
   signals impermanence — readers don't mistake it for a finalized architecture.
4. **Offline / air-gapped environment?** → **Mermaid** (renders client-side) or
   **PlantUML with local jar** (avoid the public plantuml.com server).
5. **Diagram must be editable by non-developers?** → **Excalidraw** (GUI
   editor) — text-based tools require syntax knowledge.

### When to mix tools in one document

A single ADR or design doc can use all three:

- **Mermaid** for the decision tree (renders inline, no server)
- **PlantUML** for the detailed sequence diagram (precise UML, auto-layout)
- **Excalidraw** for the whiteboard sketch of the proposed architecture
  (signals "this is a draft, not a finalized design")

## Why

Picking the wrong tool creates friction at the worst time: a Mermaid diagram
that uses syntax the renderer doesn't support, a PlantUML diagram that can't
render because the server is unreachable, or an Excalidraw diagram that's a
binary blob in git history. Matching the tool to the output type and rendering
environment up front avoids rework.

## When this practice applies

- Writing ADRs, design docs, or README files that embed diagrams.
- Documentation that will be read in multiple environments (GitHub, Obsidian,
  VS Code preview, static site).
- Whiteboard sessions that need to be captured and version-controlled.

## When this practice does NOT apply

- **Architecture diagrams as code (C4 model, Structurizr)** — those are
  application architecture tools, not documentation embedding tools.
- **UI mockups** — use Figma, Sketch, or a dedicated UI tool.
- **Data visualizations** — use a charting library (Chart.js, D3, Plotly).
