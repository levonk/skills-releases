# Iron-Proxy Egress Firewall

## Failure Mode

CI pipelines make unrestricted outbound network requests. Supply chain attacks,
data exfiltration, and unauthorized dependency downloads go undetected. No
audit trail of which domains CI jobs contact.

## Practice

Wrap CI build processes with **iron-proxy-action** — an egress firewall for CI
pipelines that intercepts and validates all outbound network traffic against an
allowlist.

### How It Works

1. Workflow file (`.github/workflows/iron-proxy.yml`) generated from shared partial
2. `egress-rules.yaml` defines allowed domains (npm registry, Node.js, GitHub)
3. Job gated by `if: vars.IRON_PROXY_ENABLED == 'true'` — disabled by default
4. Action installs iron-proxy, redirects DNS through it, locks down outbound with iptables
5. Summary step prints every domain contacted and whether allowed or denied

### Enabling

1. Review `egress-rules.yaml` and add additional domains your build requires
2. Set repository variable: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** → `IRON_PROXY_ENABLED = true`
3. Run the workflow (triggers on push, PR, manual dispatch)
4. Start with `warn: true` (default) to see all traffic without blocking
5. Once allowlist is dialed in, set `warn: false` to enforce blocking

### Templates with Iron-Proxy Support

- `repo/pnpm-monorepo/` — pnpm monorepo with Nx build orchestration

### Adding to New Templates

1. Create `.github/workflows/iron-proxy.yml.jinja` with partial include
2. Create `egress-rules.yaml.jinja` with partial include
3. Adjust build steps if template uses a different build tool
